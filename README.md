# py_prjcts
My projects in Python. All of them are simple, since I am still a begginer.

Not much to explain here since it's just a collection of very simple projects. The purpose of these projects is to practice and 
improve my python skills, which are very basic.

If, for some reason, you want to take a peek, go ahead! I am open to feedback and suggestions from anyone willing to help me
improve my code.
